## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.


## Incoming change
Our next steps to make our app even more exceptional
will be:
- finishing integration with external API for recipes
- improve the design of our landing page,
- improve the view of user profile,
- improve performance
- use PostgresSQL instead of SQLite3
- make some custom signals
- introduce MessageBroker for asynchronously sending notifications
